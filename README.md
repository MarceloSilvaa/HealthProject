# HealthProject

The goal of this project is to help people manage information about the supplements they use. 

There are two versions of this project:
1. [Client only](#client-only)
2. [Client and server](#client-and-server)

## Client only

This version uses the browser local storage to keep all the data.

Data can be downloaded as a JSON file and be loaded after, using that same file.

You can see the [code here](https://github.com/MarceloSilvaa/HealthProject/tree/client-only) and test the [deployment here](https://marcelosilvaa.github.io/HealthProject).

## Client and server

This version is still in progress...

You can see the [code here](https://github.com/MarceloSilvaa/HealthProject/tree/client-server).
